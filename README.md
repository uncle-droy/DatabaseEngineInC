Simple File Based Database Engine in C

This is a simple database engine which stores data in separate TXT files for now (in future we will use .bin files).

The following commands are working properly:
- OPEN: Select a database file to work on
- CREATE: Create a new database file
- OVERVIEW: Show list of all data inside a db
- INSERT: Insert new data in the database
- ROWDELETE: Delete a particular column of data or row of data or the selected table or the opened database

Commands and features yet to come:
- Edit a particular cell data
- Delete entire columns
- Rename a field
- Select statments to show particular data
- Primary key system
